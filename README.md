# ESC-2024
A small project for predicting the result of ESC 2024. Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/diamondsnake/eurovision-song-contest-data

Based on scoring data from seven Eurovision Song Contests between 2016 and 2023, I used a conditional logistic regression to model the scoring preferences of the participating countries. Using this model, I predicted the outcome of this year's competition using data from the participating countries in 2024. The predictions (see below) show that France, Italy, and the Netherlands have the top three probabilities of winning, followed by Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland.
